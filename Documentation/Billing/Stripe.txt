- I need stripe for different points in the billing process
1. For when a task is complete. I should trigger an invoice or get auto approval when the job is done
    - auto approval when a task has been completed
        - this will happen when the customer agrees to the job once it is done
        - to do job we will need a card on file
        - there will have to be a place for them to sign up for the app
2. Monthly invoice
    - monthly charge for the pool service sent out on a certain date
        - first of each month
            - if the customer has the attribute of beginning of month then their bill is due net 30
            - if the customer has the attribute of end of month then the bill is due upon receipt
        - should have an autopay option for the customers
            - can be opted upon sign up
            - can be opted later
3. features
    - we will need a place to see past invoices
    - we will need to see invoices that are still pending
    - we will need to handle past due invoices
    - we will need to institute late charges on invoices
    - we will need to implement autopay and offer a discount to try and switch them over if they are not switched
    - will need to have cron jobs that will auto create invoices at the beginning of the month if certain criteria is met
        - no tasks have been created

1. One-Time Job Payments (Task Completion)

Flow:
	1.	Customer Must Have a Card on File
        •	Require customers to add a card during signup or before confirming a job.
        •	Use Stripe’s SetupIntent API to securely store payment details.
	2.	Auto Approval Upon Completion
        •	When a job is completed, trigger an invoice or charge the stored card.
        •	If the customer has “Auto Approve” enabled:
        •	Automatically charge the card on file.
        •	If not:
        •	Send an invoice and require manual approval.
	3.	Invoice Generation
        •	If payment is not auto-approved, create a Stripe invoice.
        •	Notify the customer via email and the app.
        •	Allow the customer to pay manually.
	4.	Customer Sign-Up Flow
        •	Ensure the app has a signup flow that collects:
        •	Customer details
        •	Payment info
        •	Preferences (Auto Pay, Approval Requirements, etc.)

- Customer only section of routes they can go to
- Sign Up for the application
    - 5% discount with autopay
- Terms of service for billing
    - autopay
    - repair payments
- Implement feature where once a task is complete then an invoice is created and the card is ran.
- I want to merge the prior invoices from Jemmson to KPS Pools
    - could be an API that pulls from there instead of transferring completely
    - Or until that is complete only do new customers on KPSPools site
    - need to be able to reflect cash pay


2. Monthly Invoicing for Pool Service

Billing Logic:
	1.	Invoice Generation on the 1st of Each Month
        •	If a customer has the “beginning of the month” attribute:
        •	Invoice is due in 30 days (NET 30).
        •	If a customer has the “end of the month” attribute:
        •	Invoice is due immediately (Due Upon Receipt).
	2.	Autopay Option
	•	Allow customers to opt in during signup or later.
	•	If enabled:
	•	Charge the card on file automatically on the due date.
	•	If not enabled:
	•	Send an invoice and remind the customer.
	3.	Handling Past Due Invoices
	•	Flag unpaid invoices as overdue.
	•	Automatically retry payment (using Stripe’s Smart Retries).
	•	Apply late fees after a grace period.
	4.	Offering an Autopay Discount
	•	Implement a discount for customers who switch to autopay.
	•	Example: “Get 5% off your monthly bill when you enable autopay.”

Automation (Cron Jobs)
	•	Auto-create invoices at the beginning of each month if:
	•	The customer has an active service plan.

1. I need to assign all things bought from SCP to a task that was added to the system. this means going into
 the SCP invoices for the month and seeing who has created the invoice and then looking at the tasks
 that were assigned to that person and seeing if the match a task. This means I need each invoice row to have a
 name next to the row and a task description and price. I need to be able to mark it as completed or in inventory.
 I should have the task in the database associated with an invoice task row. This should be another column in invoice
 items with the task id which can be null.

2. If a task has been completed and invoiced then I need to mark it as paid.

3. I need to go through my schedule in Notes and make sure there is a task associated to each thing that I
 completed.

4. I need to talk to my guys and make sure all tasks that have been completed have been marked as complete

5. I need to go through the notes section in service stops and make sure that a task has been assigned to
 each note that says a task was created

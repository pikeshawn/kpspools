You’re thinking about this in exactly the right way—you want to charge fairly while ensuring your time is valued. Here are a few approaches to structure your service stop fee in a way that feels transparent and reasonable to customers:

✅ Best Approaches

1️⃣ Charge a Service Stop Fee, But Make It Clearly a Deposit
	•	Instead of calling it a “service stop fee”, call it a “deposit toward work.”
	•	Example:
“We charge a $75 service visit deposit, which is credited toward the total cost of the work if approved.”
	•	If the total job cost is less than the deposit, the minimum charge remains the deposit amount (because you had to make the trip).

✅ Why this works?
	•	Customers don’t feel like they’re being “nickel and dimed.”
	•	It communicates that you’re not doing free quotes, but you’re fair.
	•	If they approve the work, they don’t lose anything—it’s just a prepayment.

2️⃣ Implement a Tiered Approach

If you don’t want to charge a full visit fee every time, try a tiered pricing model:
	•	$50 Service Stop Fee → Credited if the job is $200+
	•	$75 Service Stop Fee → Credited if the job is $300+
	•	No Credit → If the job is less than the service stop fee.

✅ Why this works?
	•	Encourages customers to bundle repairs together.
	•	Feels less like a penalty and more like a logical system.

3️⃣ Offer a Flat Fee for “Small Jobs”
	•	If someone only needs a tiny repair (e.g., $50 job), offer a flat rate for small work.
	•	Example: ”$100 minimum charge covers the visit + small repairs. If the work exceeds $100, the full amount is credited.”

✅ Why this works?
	•	Customers understand that no job is “too small”, but there’s a cost for sending someone out.
	•	Keeps things simple and predictable.

4️⃣ Explain the Business Logic to Customers (In a Way They Understand)

Instead of just saying “That’s the policy”, use a customer-friendly approach:
	•	“Our service visit fee ensures we can get an expert technician to your location. If you approve the repair, we credit the fee toward the work. If the repair cost is below the visit fee, we still have to cover our technician’s time, which is why there’s a minimum charge.”

✅ Why this works?
	•	Customers see that you’re not just padding your pricing.
	•	It frames the fee as part of the value of professional service.

🚀 The Bottom Line

✔ Use the “credit toward work” approach so customers don’t feel tricked.
✔ Set a reasonable minimum charge for jobs below the service fee.
✔ Be transparent—explain why the policy exists.
✔ Consider tiered pricing for different service levels.

- I want to be able to pull from Assessor on the add page to pre populate the fields
- Steps
    - I type in a name or an address in a combobox
    - styled in tailwind, vue and modern
    - with the keystroke a request is made in the backend
        - the backend
            - runs a query on the owners table
                - pull json response with these columns
                    - ownership
                    - mailing_address_1
                    - mailing_city
                    - mailing_zip
                    - sale_date
                    - sale_price
   - Front end
        - display results in a drop down
        - user selects the result
        - once selected the json response matches the fields to
            - customer.firstName = parsed ownership by first space where the first word is the firstName
            - customer.lastName = the last half of parsed ownership
            - customer.address = mailing_address_1
            - customer.city = mailing_city
            - customer.zip = mailing_zip
        - have a label that displays the sale_date and sale_price

                {
                    "first_name": Justin,
                    "last_name" :Schudel
                    'order': 1

            ]
        - servicemen
            - [
                {
                    id:10
                    name:Blake

                    name:Blake
                }
              ]
    - each of these rows is displayed in a card form
    - for each row I also have a drop down button of the serviceman that I can transfer
        a particular customer to
        - it is only displayed if the user is an admin
            - v-if="user.is_admin === 1"
        - functionality is
            transfer(addressId) {
                        Inertia.post('/transfer/storeFromCustomers', {'address': address})
                    },
    - I need a button to go to the customer that implements this logic
        - goToCustomer(id) {
                      Inertia.get('customers/show/' + id);
                  },
    - need the row to marked that a pool was completed if the completed is true and
        denoted as false if completed is marked as false

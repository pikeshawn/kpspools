What Our Service Looks Like

    At KPS Pools, we take pride in delivering top-quality pool maintenance to ensure your pool remains
    clean, balanced, and ready to enjoy. Our comprehensive service stop includes brushing the sides,
    checking and adding necessary chemicals, emptying all baskets, and vacuuming as needed -
    leaving your pool spotless after every visit. To keep you informed, our technician provides a detailed
    service report upon completion, including the time in and out, chemical levels, and tasks performed,
    so you always know exactly what was done. We stand by our work with a satisfaction guarantee - if
    your pool is not cleaned to your expectations, our technician will return to make it right.

Vacation Billing at KPS Pools

    Our monthly billing is based on a 4-week cycle, ensuring predictable service charges. Any extra 5th
    service weeks are balanced over vacation periods - two weeks during Thanksgiving and two weeks
    over Christmas.

Monthly & Weekly Rates

    Our monthly billing divides your service cost into a weekly rate for consistency. For seasonal
    customers, we offer a flexible weekly rate starting at $110 per week, with chemicals not included.

Repairs & Service Stops

    Every repair visit includes a service stop fee, credited toward the repair cost if work is approved.
    Fees: $80 for jobs under $200, $100 for jobs over $200. The fee is charged at the time of visit and
    applied to the final repair cost.

Billing & Payment Process

    Billing occurs at the start of each month. You will receive a text with a payment link to Jemmson, our
    payment processing platform. We use Stripe for secure transactions, and auto-pay is available.

Communication & Route Changes

    We primarily communicate via text messaging for service updates and billing. Route changes,
    including service day or technician updates, will be notified via text on Sunday afternoons.

1. Customer is flat rate for every month
    1. addresses table -> plan_duration = monthly
2. Pull all addresses from addresses table where
    1. address is active => active column = 1
    2. plan_duration column = monthly
    3. sold column does not = 1
3. Customer table maps to address table -> customer_id column
4. check # of services in a month. if 5 then add that to the free week variable. record the last week date.
    1. for each address
        1. count all service stops starting for each month in 2024
            1. service_stops table where
                1. address_id = $addresses->id
                2. service_type = 'Service Stop'
            2. if service stop count is greater than 4 then add 1 to $freeWeeks variable
            3. once finished then record the $freeWeeks variable in the csv file
    2. If $freeWeeks variable =
            1. 0 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .05 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * .5
            2. 1 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .75 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * .5
            3. 2 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .75 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * .75
            4. 3 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .75 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * 1
            5. 4 or Greater then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * 1 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * 1


3. figure start date
    1. for each address
        1. count all service stops starting from 1/1/2024 to 11/1/2024
            1. service_stops table where
                1. address_id = $addresses->id
                2. service_type = 'Service Stop'
            2. (Count the number of weeks in the year from the week of the first date that is on or after 1/1/2024)
                - (self::weeksBasedOnFourWeekMonth())
                    2. If result =
                        1. 0 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .05 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * .5
                        2. 1 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .75 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * .5
                        3. 2 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .75 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * .75
                        4. 3 then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * .75 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * 1
                        5. 4 or Greater then $novemberPrice = November plan_price * 1 and $decemberPrice = December plan_price * 1
            3. Create a csv file with columns of
                1. Headers -> 'Address Id', First Name, Last Name, Address, Plan Price, November Price, December Price, Free Weeks
                2. $customer->first_name, $customer->last_name, $address->plan_price, $novemberPrice, $decemberPrice, $freeWeeks


weeksBasedOnFourWeekMonth
1. Number of weeks first month
2. if # of services in that month is > than 4 then count it as 4 then
    1. add (4 * the number of months up to 11/1)
2. Examples
    1. So if start date is say 2/15/2024 then
        1. count the number of service weeks in February
        2. there are 8 months from March to April so
            1. 8 * 4 = 32
        3. $total = 32 + + (number of service weeks in March) = 35 weeks
    2. if start date is say 3/20/2024 then
        1. count the number of service weeks in March
        2. there are 7 months from March to April so
            1. 7 * 4 = 28
        3. $total = 28 + (number of service weeks in March) = 30 weeks
    3. if start date is say 4/2/2024 then
        1. count the number of service weeks in March
            1. since this count is = 5 then simply count the number of weeks at 4
        2. there are 6 months from March to April so
            1. 6 * 4 = 24
        3. $total = 24 + (number of service weeks in March) = 28 weeks


1. get service weeks
    1. $firstServiceDate = first service date in year
        1. for each address from the addresses table where active = true and sold is not null
        2. service_stops table where address_id = address.id
    2. $weekInYear = get week in year it is
    3. $serviceWeeks = (44 - $weekInYear) + 1
2. Billed Weeks
    1. $weeksInFirstMonth =
        1. # of serviceStops in first month
            1. if count >= 4 then result is 4
            2. if less then result = count
    2. $billedWeeks = $weeksInFirstMonth + # of remaining months through October * 4
3. $unBilledWeeks = $serviceWeeks - $billedWeeks


1. check # of services in a month. if 5 then add that to the free week variable. record the last week date.
2. go through each address based upon sold does not equal 1 and active equals 1 in address
3. go through each month of the year
    1. count service_stops for the address for that month.
    2. if service stop count is greater than 4 then add 1 to $freeWeeks variable
    3. once finished then record the $freeWeeks variable in the csv file



Paying my guys
1. go through current employees
2. (count total # of services completed for the year * 20) - total paid for year = how much I owe them
    1. some of the guys have recorded more than one service per week
        1. like a missed service and then an actual service
        2. there is a total expected per week - once a week - # of weeks since started
        3. total # of services recorded
        4. should be equal if not then flag it
    2. I should have a table for paychecks with guys
        1. paychecks
            1. id
            2. user_id
            3. pay_amount
            4. description
            5. payment_date
            6. payment_method

Dugan
    1. Blake created a repair for Mary Dugan
    2. created with a name but not a drop down
    3.



todo - add quantity to task view
todo - add quantity to message to customer
todo - jobRate not changing when time to complete changes

- Logic
    1. I type into a description field that will have a drop down if the item is in the database or nothing if the item
        is new
        - If item is in the drop down it will pull back one of two types
            1. SCP Item
                -
                - json fields for each item
                    - description : SUCTION CLEANER HOSE
                      jobRate : null
                      jobTypeId : null
                      price : 9.81
                      product_number : PSL-201-7001
                      repairmanRate : null
                      type : scpItem
            2. Task Item
                - json fields for each item
                    - description : Filter clean
                      jobRate : 120
                      jobTypeId : 6
                      price : 120
                      product_number : null
                      repairmanRate : 80
                      type : taskItem
        - else there is just the new description and nothing is pulled back from the database
    2. Job Rate would use this formula
        1. - {Total Price} = ({Cost of Parts} * {Markup}) + ({Tech Hourly Rate} * 3)
            - {Cost of Parts} = price from the task item that was returned
                - would also be times the quantity that is being attributed to it -> form.quantity
            - {Markup} would use this table
                -  if (price <= 50) {
                      return price * 2.08
                  } else if (price <= 100) {
                      return price * 1.83
                  } else if (price <= 500) {
                      return price * 1.73
                  } else if (price <= 1000) {
                      return price * 1.53
                  } else if (price > 1000) {
                      return price * 1.43
                  }
            - {Tech Hourly Rate} would use this table
                - price * the multiplier where the name is the estimated time duration of the repair ->
                    [

                    - I need the hourly rate to tied to a label to display to my guys
            - I have an input for quantity and a drop down for time duration
            - I need to be able to change the values for quanity and time to complete to update the prices for my guys and
                and the job rate accurately

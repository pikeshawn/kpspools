    2. pull all tasks from the tasks table where columns
        assigned = sub,
        status = status,
        updated_at is > startDate and < endDate
    3. add results to the created array
    4. for each task that is pulled back
        - pull all statuses from the task_statuses table where column task_id = task.id
        - pull back id, customer_id, address_line_1, city, zip from the addresses table where
            the addresses.id = task.address_id
        - pull back first_name, last_name from customers table where the customer.id = addresses.customer_id
            - add the name to the customer array

                - in format - env("APP_URL") . "/customers/show/" . address.id
        - create a sub array and add it to the task array
            - beenPaid => task.subPaid
            - rate => task.rate

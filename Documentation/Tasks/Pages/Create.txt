Repair Rate
- this needs to come from the GetTaskItems method in the Task Controller
- the getTaskItems method must pull the rate for from the rate table
- if the rate table does not have an entry then the result is null
- I need to cycle through the results and check the rates table
- I need to pull from a Tasks table too and get items

- I want to pull from the tasks table and get only distinct rows
    that match a given input. I want to pull columns description, price, scp_id

- I want to pull from the rates table - any item that matches
    rates

- I need a table that has the rates that I charge for a particular job. the rates for the job
    are what I pay the serviceman and what I charge for the job itself.
    - the servicemen are in the users table and each of them can have one rate per job
    - this seems like a many to many table between the users table and the rates table.
    the rate that I charge for a job is a one to one relationship for a job


- For each item that is pulled back with the selection - I need to
    look into the user_rates_table and see if there is an entry for
    the selected service guy and a rate associated to the repair.
    if there is not then it is null as it is returned.


- I get the item that has a name in the description field
- I use the name to look up the id the job_types table
- I use the id in that table to look up the rate in the user job rates table

ðŸ›‘ Issue Identified: Different Request Behavior on Local vs. Server

From your logs, the key difference is:
	1.	On Local (Works Fine):
	â€¢	File is detected as an image/jpeg.
	â€¢	No errors in file processing.
	â€¢	Correct realPath and file properties are set.
	2.	On Server (Fails):
	â€¢	File has an error code (-error: 1).
	â€¢	File path is empty (pathname: "").
	â€¢	MIME type is incorrect (application/octet-stream instead of image/jpeg).

ðŸ›  What Causes This?
	â€¢	error: 1 in Laravelâ€™s UploadedFile means UPLOAD_ERR_INI_SIZE
	â€¢	This means the uploaded file exceeds the limit set in PHP configuration and was rejected before Laravel could access it.
	â€¢	Since the file is missing (realPath: ""), Laravel receives an empty request body.

                    - When work is performed then handle the accounting
                    - When a given stop occurs
                        - a stop is found in service_stops table
                            - where ss.address_id = address.id

                            - $labor = 20$ * number of stops
                                - 20$ per stop
                    - create sums for each
                        - total income from all stops
                        - total costs for all stops
                    - generate a json object

        - Each individual customer
    - 5 stops
        - accurral
            - will reflect a stop that wont billed for until the vacation weeks so it will record extra income and extra expense
        - cash
            - show less than the accrural because I dont get the cash until the end of the year


    - All active customers
        - select * customers c join addresses a on c.id = a.customer_id where a.active = 1 and a.sold <> 1
